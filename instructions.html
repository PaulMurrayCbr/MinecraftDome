		<h1>Minecraft Dome</h1>

		<p>Before I start, please note that there's no save/restore/undo
			in this version of MinecraftDome. If it gets slow, hit the
			"Calculating …" button in the "Generation parameters" thingy. This
			will put it into "idle" mode. Press the button again to resume
			calculating. "Reset" also stops calculations and will also zero the
			calculated heights. This is handy if things start zipping off into
			infinity.</p>
		<p>MinecraftDome seems to work ok for me in Firefox 54.0.1 on a
			6-year-old MacBook Pro. YMMV.</p>
		<h2>Defining the surface and its supports</h2>
		<p>Ok. First, use the "surface layer" area to create a surface
			layer. Just fill in a circle (for a dome) or a rectangle or
			something. Click and drag to set/delete squares. Note that ths can be
			clunky if you have the calculations ticking over while you do it.</p>
		<p>Make sure your surface is all connected. The calculations are
			done using a square mesh, so by "connected" I mean the squares need
			to share a face - diagonals don't count.</p>

		<p>There is a monumentally clunky set of controlls for drawing
			rectangles and ellipses - hit the hide/show drawing controls button.
			it's pretty self-explanatory, except for the "ellipse power" field.
			This allows you to draw diamonds and hyperellipses. 1 gives a
			diamond, 2 gives an ellipse, and 2.4 gives a nice hyperellipse.
			Infinity will give you a rectangle, but there is a separate button
			for that.</p>

		<p>Next, create an anchor layer. In that anchor layer, anchor down
			at least one block of the surface by clicking it. Typically you'd do
			more than this. For instance, to create a dome you'd anchor down the
			circumference of your surface. To make an arch, you'd create a
			longish rectangular surface and anchor down the two ends.</p>

		<p>You can manipulate the y positions of the anchor blocks by
			fooling about with the values of the red/green/blue anchors. All
			anchors in a given layer will be treated as laying on the plane
			defined by those points. This allows you to - for instance - create a
			colonade with a given elevation at each end.</p>

		<h2>Fooling about with the dome generation parameters</h2>

		<p>In the generation parmeters section is a button that says
			"Idle" or "Calculating". Frob it to turn calculations on/off. There's
			also a reset button, to kill things and put them back to zero.</p>
		<p>
			You would nomally use this app to generate the <em>roof</em> of a
			structure. That is, the floor of your awesome house will probably be
			two or three blocks below your defined anchor points, with nice
			quartz columns where those anchor points are. So keep that in mind
			when judging whether or not the shape looks too flat or too high.
		</p>

		<h3>Parabolic load</h3>

		<p>The "parabolic" value applies a constant load across the
			surface and adjusts the surface to bear that load. In consequence,
			the surface will adopt a nice parabolic shape constrained by your
			anchor points. Larger values give a steeper parabola. This is a
			suitable shape for a roof bearing rock.</p>

		<h3>Catenary load</h3>

		<p>The "catenary" value applies a load across the surface based on
			the area of the surface and adjusts the surface to bear that load. In
			consequence, the surface will adopt a catenary shape - the shape of a
			self-supporting structure. Negative values will create shapes that
			"hang" from their anchor points under thier own weight.</p>

		<p>Catenary shapes tend to give a flatter dome than parabolic,
			with sides that are steeper.</p>

		<p>The catenary calculations can tend to zip off to infinity,
			unfortunately, so keep that mouse over the "reset" button.</p>

		<h3>Roof load</h3>

		<p>A roof load allows you to set a roof height, applying a load
			across the surface proportional to how close the surface is to that
			height. I belive this also produces a catenary shape (hyperbolic
			cosine). Odd but cool things are likely to happen if you put some
			anchors above this height and some below it. Negative values for load
			are likely to send the roof off to infinity.</p>

		<p style="font-size: smaller; margin: 0 2em;">
			<b>Math nerd alert:</b> At one limit (infinite load), the dome tends
			to adopt a post-and-lintel shape. This is the shape of cosh(x) for
			very large x. At the other limit (infinitessimal load, infinite
			height), the dome tends to adopt a parabolic shape. This is the shape
			of cosh(x) in the region around zero.
		</p>

		<h3>No load</h3>

		<p>If both values are zero, then you'll get a soap-bubble effect.
			I think what happens is that the engine computes a minimal surface.
			Of course, if all your anchor points are in one layer and therefore
			coplanar, you'll wind up with something flat.</p>


		<ul>
			<li>TODO: Add a "constant volume" option. I suspect this will
				create spheres and psudeospheres. The calculation will be a shade
				tricky.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Display Options</h2>
		<p>Next, have a look at what's in the awesome greenish 3-d window.
			Your anchor points are red octahedra.</p>

		<p>There are some buttons to move the view around a bit. Click and
			hold. If the action gets choppy, turn off the "calculating" thing.
			Yeah, I could implement some mouse-draggy action, but I didn't. The
			buttons are all you get.</p>
		<p>There are some display options. The "Ideal blocks" checkbox
			turns on some semitransparent cubes centered at exactly the computed
			grid points.</p>
		<p>The "lines" checkbox turns on a yellow grid.</p>
		<p>But you are interested in the "minecraft" checkbox. Turn it on
			to see cubes placed in columns defining the shape. "Join faces" means
			that adjacent cubes must connect on a face, as opposed to it being ok
			to connect on a diagonal.</p>

		<h2>Generating some stuff you can print out and use as a plan for
			building the actual shape in-game</h2>

		<p>When you have the shape you want, or something vaguely like
			what you want, hit the "generate construction plans" button. This
			will open a new window and produce a set of plans in fixed-width
			plain text that you can copy/paste or print.</p>

		<p>Lines are drawn every 16 blocksfor the X and Z axwes, and every
			8 for the Y axis. This should allow you to line up what you are doing
			with the chunk boundaries in game - use F3-something to see those
			boundaries. Use the offset controls to offset the generated chuink
			boundary lines.</p>

		<h2>Sending me some money</h2>

		<p>
			If you use and enjoy this tool, or even if you just use it, consider
			dropping a buck or two into my paypal <b>pmurray@bigpond.com</b>. Two
			bucks will be fine. Why not drop in even more if you want to use this
			tool a lot? You know, if you drop ten or twenty bucks into my paypal,
			you could use this thing for years and years before being overcome
			with wracking pangs of guilt!
		</p>
		<p>
			If you wish to email me about this, you can send it to that address <b>pmurray@bigpond.com</b>.
			However, I get a metric tonne of spam. Please put "MinecraftDome" in
			the subject.

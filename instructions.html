<h1>Minecraft Dome</h1>

<p>Before I start, please note that there's no save/restore/undo in this version of MinecraftDome. If it gets slow, hit the 
	"Calculating â€¦"  button beneath the 3d display window thingy. This will put it into "idle" mode. Press the button again
	to resume calculating. "Reset" also stops calculations and will also zero the calculated heights. This is handy if things
	start zipping off into infinity. 
<p>

<p>Ok. First, use the "surface layer" area to create a surface layer. Just fill in a circle (for a dome) or
a rectangle or something. USe your mouse, it's not difficult to figure out. 
Make sure your surface is all connected. The calculations are done using a
square mesh, so by "connected" I mean the squares need to share a face - diagonals don't count.
</p>

<p>
Next, create an anchor layer. In that anchor layer, anchor down at least one block of the surface by clicking it. Typically you'd do more than this.
For instance, to create a dome you'd anchor down the circumference of your surface. To make an arch, you'd create a longish
rectangular surface and anchor down the two ends.
</p>

<p>
You can manipulate the y positions of the anchor blocks by fooling about with the values of the red/green/blue anchors. All anchors
in a given layer will be treated as laying on the plane defined by those points. This allows you to - for instance - 
create a colonade with agiven elevation at each end.
</p>

<p>Next, have a look at what's in the awesome greenish 3-d window. Your anchor points are red octagons. There's a button that says
"Idle" or "Calculating". Frob it to turn calculations on/off. There's also a reset button, to kill things and put them back to zero.
</p>

<p>The "parabolic" value applies a constant load across the surface and adjusts the surface to bear that load. In consequence,
the surface will adopt a nice parabolic shape constrained by your anchor points. Larger values give a steeper parabola. This is a 
suitable shape for a roof bearing rock.</p>

<p>The "catenary" value applies a load across the surface based on the area of the surface and adjusts the surface to bear that load. In consequence,
the surface will adopt a catenary shape - the shape of a self-supporting structure. Negative values will create shapes that "hang" from their anchor points
under thier own weight.
</p>
<p>
The catenary calculations can tend to zip 
off to infinity, unfortunately, so keep that finger over the "reset" button.  </p>

<p>If both values are zero, then you'll get a soap-bubble effect. I think what happens is that the engine computes a minimal
surface. Of course, if all your anchor points are in one layer and therefore coplanar, you'll wind up with something flat.</p>

<p>TODO: add a "roof" calculation, where the load is proportional to height below a roof. I belive this will also give catenary shapes, but in a more constrained way.</p>
<p>TODO: Add a "constant volume" option. I suspect this will create spheres and psudeospheres. The calculation will be a shade tricky.</p>

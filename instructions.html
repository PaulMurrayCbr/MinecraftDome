	<h1>Minecraft Dome</h1>

	<p>Before I start, please note that there's no save/restore/undo in
		this version of MinecraftDome. If it gets slow, hit the "Calculating
		…" button beneath the 3d display window thingy. This will put it into
		"idle" mode. Press the button again to resume calculating. "Reset"
		also stops calculations and will also zero the calculated heights.
		This is handy if things start zipping off into infinity.
	<p>
	<h2>Defining the surface and its supports</h2>
	<p>Ok. First, use the "surface layer" area to create a surface
		layer. Just fill in a circle (for a dome) or a rectangle or something.
		Use your mouse, for God's sake: it's not difficult to figure out. Make
		sure your surface is all connected. The calculations are done using a
		square mesh, so by "connected" I mean the squares need to share a face
		- diagonals don't count.</p>

	<p>Next, create an anchor layer. In that anchor layer, anchor down
		at least one block of the surface by clicking it. Typically you'd do
		more than this. For instance, to create a dome you'd anchor down the
		circumference of your surface. To make an arch, you'd create a longish
		rectangular surface and anchor down the two ends.</p>

	<p>You can manipulate the y positions of the anchor blocks by
		fooling about with the values of the red/green/blue anchors. All
		anchors in a given layer will be treated as laying on the plane
		defined by those points. This allows you to - for instance - create a
		colonade with agiven elevation at each end.</p>

	<h2>Fooling about with the dome generation parameters</h2>

	<p>Next, have a look at what's in the awesome greenish 3-d window.
		Your anchor points are red octahedra. There's a button that says
		"Idle" or "Calculating". Frob it to turn calculations on/off. There's
		also a reset button, to kill things and put them back to zero.</p>

	<p>There are some buttons to move the view around a bit. Click and
		hold. If the action gets choppy, turn off the "calculating" thing.
		Yeah, I could implement some mouse-draggy action, but I didn't. The
		buttons are all you get.</p>

	<p>The "parabolic" value applies a constant load across the surface
		and adjusts the surface to bear that load. In consequence, the surface
		will adopt a nice parabolic shape constrained by your anchor points.
		Larger values give a steeper parabola. This is a suitable shape for a
		roof bearing rock.</p>

	<p>The "catenary" value applies a load across the surface based on
		the area of the surface and adjusts the surface to bear that load. In
		consequence, the surface will adopt a catenary shape - the shape of a
		self-supporting structure. Negative values will create shapes that
		"hang" from their anchor points under thier own weight.</p>

	<p>The catenary calculations can tend to zip off to infinity,
		unfortunately, so keep that mouse over the "reset" button.</p>

	<p>If both values are zero, then you'll get a soap-bubble effect. I
		think what happens is that the engine computes a minimal surface. Of
		course, if all your anchor points are in one layer and therefore
		coplanar, you'll wind up with something flat.</p>


	<p>
		You would nomally use this app to generate the <em>roof</em> of a
		structure. That is, the floor of your awesome house will probably be
		two or three blocks below your defined anchor points, with nice quartz
		columns where those anchor points are. So keep that in mind when
		judging whether or not the shape looks too flat or too high.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>TODO: add a "roof" calculation, where the load is
			proportional to height below a roof. I belive this will also give
			catenary shapes, but in a more constrained way.</li>

		<li>TODO: Add a "constant volume" option. I suspect this will
			create spheres and psudeospheres. The calculation will be a shade
			tricky.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Generating some stuff you can print out and use as a plan for
		building the actual shape in-game</h2>

	<p>There are some display options. The "Ideal blocks" checkbox
		turns on some semitransparent cubes centered at exactly the computed
		grid points. The "lines" checkbox turns on a yellow grid.</p>
	<p>But you are interested in the "minecraft" checkbox. Turn it on
		to see cubes placed in columns defining the shape. "Use half slabs"
		uses half slabs. "Join faces" means that adjacent cubes must connect
		on a face, as opposed to it being ok to connect on a diagonal.</p>

	<p>When you have the shape you want, or something vaguely like what
		you want, hit the "generate plans" button. This will produce a set of
		plans in fixed-width plain text that you can copy/paste or print. The
		text has a tasteful chequerbord background colour in 16*8*16 cubes.
		Use the "chunk boundary offset" controls to move the starting point of
		this chequerborad around. Turn on the chunk boundary thingy in game
		(F3-something, I think) and use it to line up where to place your
		blocks.</p>

	<h2>Sending me some money</h2>

	<p>
		If you use and enjoy this tool, or even if you just use it, consider
		dropping a buck or two into my paypal <b>pmurray@bigpond.com</b>. Two
		bucks will be fine. Why not drop in even more if you want to use this
		tool a lot? You know, if you drop ten or twenty bucks into my paypal,
		you could use this thing for years and years before being overcome
		with wracking pangs of guilt!
	</p>
	<p>
		If you wish to email me about this, you can send it to that address <b>pmurray@bigpond.com</b>.
		However, I get a metric tonne of spam. Please put "MinecraftDome" in
		the subject. If you put a space in there, then obviously you have
		reading comprehension problems and I will ignore your mail because
		life is too short as it is.
	</p>
	<p>Just letting you know.</p>
